# Brain Tumor Image Segmentation 🧠🔬

## Overview  
This project implements a **deep learning pipeline for brain tumor segmentation** using MRI images.  
The model is based on a **U-Net architecture**, a widely used convolutional neural network for biomedical image segmentation.  
The project, this work demonstrates how **AI-driven image analysis** can support clinical decision-making and medical research by automating tumor boundary detection. 

## Features  
- 🧠 Brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans  
- 🏗️ U-Net based deep learning model for biomedical imaging  
- 📊 Data preprocessing, normalization, and augmentation  
- 📈 Training, validation, and performance evaluation  
- 🖼️ Visualization of predicted tumor masks vs. ground truth  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Normalization, resizing, augmentation  
2. **Model Architecture** – U-Net with encoder-decoder structure  
3. **Training & Validation** – Loss monitoring and accuracy metrics  
4. **Prediction & Segmentation** – Generate tumor masks from MRI slices  
5. **Visualization** – Compare predicted segmentation with ground truth masks  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras (U-Net model)
- OpenCV, Matplotlib (image processing & visualization)
- Scikit-learn (evaluation metrics)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how deep learning applies to biomedical imaging
- Building practical skills in U-Net and medical image analysis
- Translating AI methods into bioinformatics/healthcare applications

⚠️ Note: This project demonstrates segmentation on a **single MRI image** for educational purposes.  
Extending it to full datasets would require batch preprocessing, training loops, and larger computational resources.
